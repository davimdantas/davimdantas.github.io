PS: A note to Win3.1-users: due to the limited fonthandling abilities of Win3.1, you may experience difficulties with some of the more complex dingbat-fonts. I.e you'll get a square on the screen instead of a character. This has nothing to do with the font! The only solution, I'm afraid, is an upgrade to Win95.

PPS: many thanks to all the people throughout the world who have send us cards, letters, stickers and other nice things in return for either this font or some of the others!! We regret, that we cannot always find the time to reply directly.
